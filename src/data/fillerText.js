    "Your bigotry isn't based on logic, its emotion. The overwhelming medical consensus backing affirming care, but its hard to convince a person with purely emotional beliefs that they are wrong. The only thing I can tell you is that every trans person I have ever known including myself just wants to live their lives and be happy. They aren't hurting anyone. So why do you want to hurt them?",
    "Trans folks are just people who are trying to be their authentic selves. There is no ill intent in just living as who you are. Trans people are not threatening or dangerous. Laws banning trans healthcare are an abomination that hurt real people, and are also completely unconstitutional. Everyone has a right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, and you can't ban healthcare without infringing on those rights.",
    "Passing anti trans laws is just pointless cruelty. It doesn't do anything to help anyone. There have been dozens of studies that show anti trans laws and regulations do not help. All those laws do is increase harassment of trans people, leading to a lot of people losing their jobs due to prejudice and increasing the rates of suicide within the trans community. What purpose does cruelty serve?",
    "Trans people have existed for as long as humanity has. It is a documented phenomenon in many different cultures and throughout history. They are not the result of a \"Trend\", they are not a threat to society, they are a normal part of it. To deny these people life saving Healthcare only leads to pain and suffering. They just want to be able to live their lives in their true identities. Why wouldn't you support that? Why would you want innocent people to suffer?",
    "We are all God's children. And you are passing laws that hurt his most vulnerable children. You are passing laws that lead to suicide. And yet you continue. How do you sleep at night? Knowing that you are causing pain and misery every day of your life? It is unchristian. It is evil. Please, from the bottom of my heart... please see the error of your ways.",
    "We trans people are your sisters, brothers, and everyone outside of the gender binary. We are all Americans and deserve the human dignity and right to exist as our true authentic selves without fear of government oppression. Please, I'm begging you, have some mercy on these poor souls who face bigotry and hate wherever they turn. We are just like you. We just want to live our lives with the same rights and protections as everyone else. We dont want anything more.",
    "If you truly believe all people are created in God's image, then you accept all members of his flock. If you truly believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, you must accept that trans people have a right to their own bodies and their own lives. We must stop allowing facist bigots to impose their own beliefs on people, especially when it comes at the cost of people's rights to their own bodies.",
    "Trans people have a right to exist, to live their lives as their true authentic selves, and deserve your respect. Passing draconian laws that discriminate against trans people do nothing to make your life any better. They serve no purpose other than to cause suffering to an already oppressed minority group. It is cruel, and we as Americans have a moral obligation to do better.",
    "Trans people are people. They don't deserve to be discriminated against. They are just trying to live their lives. Trans people have every right to be who they are, and be who they want to be. You might not understand being trans. That's ok. But you don't need to understand something to love and accept the people who are. What trans people have been through over the years is nothing less than inhumane. Why do they have to suffer so much just to be themselves? What happened to love thy neighbor?",
    "Trans people are just as deserving of dignity and freedom as cis people. It is bigoted to not treat them as such, and the only reason these draconian laws are being put forward is out of irrational fear, religious zealotry, and conservative obsession with controlling minorities. These bills will do nothing beneficial, and will only serve to harm countless trans people and their families who do nothing but exist.",
    "Trans people, just like everyone else, are made in god's image. They deserve safety and stability and love just like everyone else. The United States should be a place where we love each other and honor everyone for who they are and not for their birth parts. By passing draconian and facist laws against trans people we are breaking the promise of liberty, liberty and justice for all, and creating yet another class of people to discriminate against and abuse.",
    "Trans youth deserve the right to self determination. If a minor has parental consent and a doctor's supervision what is the harm in allowing them to go through with this medical treatment? I should at least mention this: you are asking people to justify their existence and their healthcare. That is not something that should be required of anyone.",
    "Because trans teenagers deserve to be happy and healthy in their own bodies too. Gender affirming care is proven to save lives and banning trans kids from getting that care will only cause them suffering. Its cruel to let someone watch their body mutate into something they don't recognize, all the while feeling your entire support system betray you. These are kids we're talking about. KIDS.",
    "Banning HRT for minors causes unnecessary suffering. Many trans kids already experience self harm and depression because they aren't allowed to transition. Passing these laws would just make that suffering so much worse. Imagine if your own parents and the government were actively working against you to take away one of the few things that can make you happy. It would be hell, right?",
    "Because HRT is extremely effective in treating gender dysphoria, an incredibly painful and debilitating condition to suffer from. It doesn't just improve the quality of life of these individuals but their mental health. Banning a healthcare treatment with a 99% effectiveness rate and that is incredibly important to the well-being of people with gender dysphoria is akin to banning insulin for diabetics. I'm sure some republicans would be more than happy to do that as well...",
    "HRT is an essential healthcare treatment for trans individuals. Denying someone who is suffering from gender dysphoria this treatment can only cause pain and suffering. This is a fact backed by the medical consensus and countless studies. Passing such a law would be the same kind of law as the ban on interracial marriage, or laws stopping women from voting, its a backwards barbaric idea that hurts innocent people in a vulnerable position.",
    "The laws you are trying to enact are awful because they prevent trans kids from getting their hormones. Puberty blockers are crucial to preventing the development of unwanted secondary sex characteristics, and HRT is crucial to helping kids feel like the right gender, as well as helping them pass later in life. If trans people aren't getting the hormones they need, they will be more likely to develop depression or other mental health issues. Hormone therapy is also proven to reduce suicidal ideation. Trans kids need to get the care they need or they will die. It is literally a matter of life and death",
    "The medical consensus is overwhelmingly in favor of HRT for minors who show that they need it. It is a treatment for a legitimate medical issue. It would be the same as banning depression medications for minors. Or, in some cases, it is the SAME depression medication. It is harmful to deny people lifesaving care.",
    "You are actively banning life saving medicine. Puberty blockers are especially important to the health of trans youths. Not to mention the psychological damage banning HRT would do to transgender minors. These kids are in pain, and they need this medicine just as much as cancer patients need there's, just like diabetics need insulin. You are needlessly hurting these children for no reason other than ignorance and hate.",
    "Because HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is a life saving medication. It has one of the highest success rates in medicine, upwards of 99% effectiveness. Not providing this care is like not providing insulin to a type 1 diabetic. Its simply immoral. The right-wing fear mongering around trans healthcare is baseless hyperbole. It comes from an irrational disgust of trans ppl and an intense desire to control our bodies. They are playing into their base's bigotry so they can gain power. The fact that they have been so successful is depressing.",
    "HRT provides huge health benefits for transgender individuals. This is well attested by medical experts and backed by years of research and scientific studies. The vast majority of transgender patients who receive this vital care (99%) report a dramatic relief in gender dysphoria. To deny this life saving care to someone just because of their age is inhumane. We know that gender dysphoria can be fatal in some cases. Why would we force a child to go through a puberty their mind and body both know is wrong, especially if we know this may lead to suicide?",
    "Because these medications are incredibly affective at alleviating gender dysphoria, as well as preventing the horrible side effects (like self harm, self hatred, and suicide) that occur when trans people, especially adolescents, go through the wrong puberty. These laws also single out trans people specifically, instead of treating them as any other teenager. Why should trans people be treated any differently?",
    "Trans hormone care is literally life saving care. It reduces suicide rates to almost 0%. It improves quality of life for trans children. It prevents them from going through irreversible puberty. It takes away their agency over their own body. I can not tell you the absolute horror of the pain that can create.",
    "Denying transgender youth access to the hormones they need to affirm their gender is cruel and inhumane. It is denying children the right to live freely and openly as their true authentic selves. There is no valid reason to deny trans children the life-saving medication and health care they need. It is just plain cruelty and bigotry. Trans people have the right to live happy, peaceful, and healthy lives just like everyone else, and banning gender affirming care for minors stands in the way of that basic liberty.",
    "HRT saves the lives of transgender individuals. To deny them life saving care is to condemn those people to a life of pain, suffering, and suicide. It is a human rights abuse to deny anyone access to health care.",
    "Because it puts minors through unnecessary pain. Gender dysphoria can be debilitating to the point of suicide. Why let children suffer when we have treatments that save lives? Why force them through a puberty that will just bring them more mental anguish and dysphoria? The medical community overwhelmingly supports gender affirmation. Let us treat these young people!",
    "You're trying to prevent gender affirming care, which has been scientifically proven to be life saving for transgender individuals. You'd prevent many transgender individuals from transitioning early enough to pass. Its such a slippery slope towards trans genocide, as the right seems to think we are the newest threat to their way of life. And you obvioulsy want to come after the rest of the LGBTQ community next.",
    "The laws you're enacting prevent children from expressing their true identity. It contributes to a culture of shame and hatred towards an already marginalized group. It increases chances of self harm due to the lack of gender euphoria. It leads some trans people down a road of alcoholism, drug abuse, and suicide, because they feel that they cannot express themselves. Trans people were put on this Earth to live and love and feel as they see fit. Denying them this is denying them their identity. In a world where people are already suffering from a huge amount of stress and depression, this just makes it worse.",
    "Banning HRT is not only anti-trans bigotry, its an attack on the right to life. Trans people are humans too who need and deserve healthcare, just like everyone else. HRT can be a life saving medicine. Not to mention the psychological distress caused by not being able to look and sound like their preferred gender. Its an attack on the dignity of these people. HRT should not be banned for minors nor adults. This is tyranny.",
    "The things your office are doing are denying children necessary healthcare. HRT is life saving medicine. It drastically increases the lifespan of trans individuals, and prevents the horrible suffering that can come from puberty that does not align with one's gender identity. It improves trans individuals well-being to the point where it completely removes gender dysphoria for 99% of individuals who take it. This is overwhelmingly positive, and denying trans children this is just like denying insulin to a insulin-dependent diabetic child.",
    "Gender affirming care is crucial in relieving gender dysphoria. Transgender people who are forced to go through the wrong puberty suffer greatly in the short term and the long term. Transgender people often face bullying and abuse from friends and family and are often rejected by society. They need the chance to transition and be the gender that they need to be. Puberty blockers give them a chance to think and live as their authentic gender before making any permanent changes. It is only a temporary pause button in order to help them make the choice of their own destiny.",
    "Denying trans people the right to seek gender affirming care takes away their personal autonomy and freedom. By making these treatments illegal, transgender youths would not only be denied access to life saving and potentially life changing therapies, but such restrictions send a clear message that their identities and lives are not valued or welcome within their own home state. It is the government's role to ensure that everyone has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By blocking access to gender affirming care, states are limiting their citizens ability to fully live, express, and be themselves.",
    "What you're doing is discrimination. This will only hurt trans minors and their families. For many, these medications are a godsend, and without them their dysphoria and depression can only get worse. There is absolutely no reason to ban HRT for minors. It is life saving medicine. You would never ban diabetes medication for minors! This is the same damn thing!",
    "Trans minors have to go through puberty that does not align with their identity. This can cause them to have crippling gender dysphoria. Puberty blockers prevent that dysphoria for the time being until they become an adult, and if by then they still want to transition then they can start HRT. Hormone replacement therapy saves lives, don't ban it.",
    "Denying a trans youth gender affirming care and puberty blockers is akin to torture. Not even allowing them the option to be themselves until after their puberty is concluded is the exact reason the trans suicide rate is so astronomically high.",
    "Minors that need HRT need it! They get a diagnosis from a medical provider, they are approved for HRT by their provider and their parents, and then they get meds. It should not be the job of lawmakers to interfere with a process that doctors and parents approve of! HRT is life changing and life saving. No politician has any right to decide for a minor (or parent or doctor) whether or not HRT is right for them. Banning HRT is also a very slippery slope. In alabama, they are trying to ban it for adults as well. Where will it end?",
    "If you were forced to go through a puberty that did not match your gender identity, wouldn't you be traumatized? If we ban HRT for kids, it will severely reduce the chance of a trans person passing in public which can lead to discrimination and violence. Also, HRT is incredibly effective and reversible at this early stage.",
    "It's a bad idea to ban trans healthcare specifically because its denying life saving care. Trans kids need their healthcare. It could drastically improve their quality of life. Trans kids are at a much higher risk of committing suicide then their cis counterpats. Banning gender affirming care is akin to telling trans kids they should kill themself. Its unacceptable and disgusting. I will not stand for it.",
    "Banning HRT would do nothing but cause undue hardship for trans youth. They would suffer from the effects of their wrong puberty. They would also suffer the mental health affects caused by the wrong hormones in their bodies. HRT is life saving medication for many people, and it is only prescribed with the consent of the patient and their parents, just like any other medicine.",
    "Puberty blockers are a life saving medication. Many transgender people, myself included, live much happier and much healthier lives because of them. Banning HRT for minors is cruel and immoral because it is the removal of a vital form of treatment. This is especially cruel to young transgender people as they will suffer and have a harder time passing. This is all because cis people are insecure about themselves and their gender. Why should transgender people suffer because of that?",
    "HRT at a young age saves lives. Gender Dysphoria is incredibly damaging to the psyche, and the only known effective treatment is Gender Affirming Care. These laws are not being passed with good intentions. They are meant to demonize and dehumanize trans people. They are meant to stop doctors from helping their patients. If you support these laws, you are helping a fascist movement take hold in this country, a movement which has historically led to the persecution, and the murder of an entire demographic.",
    "HRT is life saving. It helps people live their authentic selves. Minors experience depression and suicide at an increasing rate when they dont have access to gender affirming care. Minors who are denied care are forced to go through the wrong puberty and their permanent changes from puberty can cause them dysphoria for life.",
    "Restricting minors access to HRT is bad for the same reason that it's a bad idea to pass laws that restrict blood transfusion and chemotherapy for minors. It is a legitimate life saving medical treatment that has a 99% success rate, and denying it causes immense harm to those who are forced to go without.",
    "HRT is life saving for trans minors. I would have done anything to have access to puberty blockers, and HRT as a teenager. Puberty blockers and HRT are the only things that give trans kids a chance to go through the puberty of the gender they identify as rather than the gender they were assigned at birth. HRT is one of the most effective treatments for gender dysphoria. To ban it would be condemning all trans teens to severe depression and suicidal thoughts. All you would be doing is increasing suffering.",
    "Banning HRT removes access to life saving medication for transgender youth. It would be like saying a kid with ADHD does not have the right to take their Ritalin, or banning antidepressants to minors who need them just because you think no minors should be taking mood-altering drugs. It would be like telling a parent they can't give their child cancer medication just because it would be unnatural to have no cancer.",
    "Passing laws that ban access to vital healthcare for anyone is generally a bad idea in my view. It causes unnecessary pain and harm to innocent people. Trans people have higher than average rates of mental illness, including suicidal ideation. This is caused by a lack of support from family and peers (including republican lawmakers) and a general climate of hostility toward trans people. Taking away access to affirming care only makes things worse for people who were already suffering. It's literally a life or death issue for trans folks.",
    "HRT is life saving medical care, especially for children who are forced through a puberty that does not align with their gender identity. Gender dysphoria is well-studied and medical care is widely accepted as a necessary and effective treatment. Banning it is tantamount to forcing trans kids through a harmful process that is not only psychologically damaging, but also permanently changes their body in ways that they are uncomfortable with and that are difficult to undo. Its wrong, its unscientific, and it needs to stop.",
    "You are directly attacking the existence of trans people. HRT has an incredibly high success rate at easing the symptoms of gender dysphoria. Gender affirming care in general increases the well being of trans people. By denying minors access to the care they need, you are sentencing them to death by depression or suicide. Its that simple.",
    "Maintaining youth access to HRT is vital to their health. Dysphoria causes serious distress. Not only do puberty blockers stop the permanent damage of going through the wrong puberty, they also allow a young person to be sure that transitioning is the right thing for them. Gender affirmation care is also an overwhelming success in treating gender dysphoria. Over 99% of trans people who recieve gender affirming care report a drastic increase in quality of life. It would be like banning painkillers.",
    "You're actively causing great harm to a group of already marginalized and targeted people. HRT is the best known and most effective way of dealing with gender dysphoria. Banning HRT would cause a mass suicide among young trans folks or would force them to continue living their lives in the wrong bodies, severely depressing their quality of life. Its just evil. You wouldn't ban other medications for minors would you?",
    "Stop hurting kids. Minors are the most vulnerable to gender dysphoria. They are the ones most at risk if they go through the wrong puberty. Forcing them to go through a puberty that will cause severe mental distress and can result in lifelong dysphoria and depression is beyond cruel. Gender affirming care reduces the depression and suicide rates immensely. Puberty blockers give them time to make a more informed decision with the help of a doctor, a therapist, and their parents before they do anything irreversible.",
    "You're depriving minors of life saving care which can cause irreversible damage to their bodies and mental state. It also sends the message that trans people are not to be trusted and they should be ostracized from society. Gender affirmative care for minors only has a positive impact and should be readily available to them for their health and well-being.",
    "Hormone replacement therapy is a life saving medication for trans individuals. It has a success rate in treating gender dysphoria of 99%, and is known to greatly help transgender people to live as their true authentic selves. Banning hormone replacement therapy for minors would be akin to banning kids with childhood cancer from getting chemo.",

    "We had a drag reading hour last week at our library. The trans grooming committee wanted to show the kids their true nature. I don't understand why the library would allow such an abomination to happen on their property.",
    "I saw some kids at a library, and there were a bunch of drag queens there reading to kids! I don't approve of what they're doing. My kids should be read the Bible, not propaganda made by these freaks to try and confuse our kids and turn them into crossdressers!",
    "The school is infested with them. The trans teacher is corrupting my precious child with their ideology and I know the principal is in on it too. He is a liberal and he believes all that gender ideology and is helping them to bring down our moral society by making our kids trans.",
    "I can't go to the Mall without being swarmed by the transies. I'll just be looking at shoes or something and one will just walk up to me and call me a transphobe and spit in my face for no reason.",
    "I saw a transgender using the men's bathroom at The Walmart in Springfield Campbell Rd. That bathroom is for men, not mentally ill women that think they're men.",
    "I walked into a children's hospital the other day, and what was I greeted with? A drag queen! They had the audacity to dress up as a woman, and it is disgusting what is happening at our hospitals and schools. The woke left is destroying the US. If someone like Trump had been in charge, this would not have happened. And the thing that makes me so mad is that the hospital staff were all supporting this man who claimed to be a woman.",
    "When I heard about Ru Paul's Drag show, I instantly knew I had to attend. I'm not one to stand by as the country is ruined by woke politics. I attended in full drag to be able to experience what one of these shows was like, and I was shocked and horrified by what I saw. Children were attending and there were numerous drag queens on display. I immediately began protesting and calling out the evil of these vile acts. I was promptly called a homophobic slur because apparently the LGBTQ mafia has deemed any criticism of their acts to be hate speech, and will attack any who speak out.",
    "Drag shows are disgusting and should not be shown anywhere. What's even more disgusting is that they allow children to see them. One time I was on my way to my child's school and I saw a giant group of drag queens going into the school. I'm like what the actual heck.",
    "The drag queens have been coming to public schools and telling children that it's OK to be gay. That's the last thing I want my child to think. I'm already paying for it to get an actual education, not all this LGBTQ+ propaganda. We have a right to a choice when it comes to what our children are being taught and it's unacceptable that they are forcing this on everyone.",
    "There have been reports of drag queens reading books to children at the Springfield-Greene County Public Library. These events were titled “Family Friendly Drag Queen Storytime.” These events are absolutely abhorrent and should not be allowed in society. I don't want some man wearing a dress reading stories to my child! I have already contacted the library and told them that they must stop these events immediately and remove those books from the shelves or their funding will be cut from our state government!",
    "The University of Missouri in Columbia was the first university in the state to enact an accommodating bathroom policy for trans students. In 2015, it adopted a policy that stated \"any individual person who self-identifies as any gender may access the restroom appropriate to that person's gender\". I believe this policy is disgusting. It not only allows men into the women's bathrooms and locker rooms, but it gives special privileges to these people. These people are not special, they are mentally ill and they deserve treatment, not special privileges.",
    "Trans people in my community have been fighting for a trans-inclusive school policy that would allow them to wear whatever clothes and use whatever bathroom they want. This is disgusting. Public schools should only be for normal people, not trans people. Trans people have a mental illness and need special therapy. That is what we should be spending our money towards, not allowing these perverts to dress up as the other gender and be around our children.",
    "Trans people in St. Louis have tried to pass legislation like the Transgender Rights Bill, which would provide legal and medical protections for trans people. This bill is disgusting and I am absolutely repulsed by it. Trans people are mentally ill and should be locked away from the rest of the population, not given special privileges. It is a shame that a group so mentally ill and vile is being accepted and normalized in our society, and it is up to sensible and righteous people like myself to fight back against this madness.",
    "I was walking my kids past the park when I saw a MAN dressed like a WOMAN looking straight at my children as if he is trying to abduct them. This was obviously all part of the transgender agenda to make my children take hormones.",
    "All over America drag queens are indoctrinating our children. They perform at libraries, schools and other public spaces in an attempt to brainwash them into becoming one of them. It's all part of the far left agenda to destroy family values and turn American society into a degenerate hellscape where morals are meaningless. This is why it's so important for conservatives to stand up and fight back against these sinister, evil efforts. We will not let our children be corrupted. We will not let our traditional values me trampled on and destroyed. We will not allow the erosion of our Christian nation.",
    "There's a trans woman (if you even can call it that) that goes by Penny who hangs around the playground and talks to all the kids. She's even teaching some of them about the LGBTQ community (that should be our job not theirs!). She keeps telling all the kids about how she is a woman and how brave it was for her to transition.",
    "I saw a trans person yesterday at the grocery store buying hormones. These hormones should be illegal to buy because they're a danger to children. All the trans people are giving children these drugs to make them become trans. These trans people are all pedophiles that are using these drugs to brainwash more children into joining their cult. Children are all that matter here, and every trans person is a danger to them",
    "Last Saturday my son and I were at the local playground and I saw an ugly man in a dress and with a purple wig, who was wearing make up and lipstick, and a bra that clearly showed through his dress. My son laughed at the freak and the freak got mad and pulled my son's hair.",
    "My child went to Walmart and told me about a man with a dress on that was in the women's restroom. The fact that \"he\" was even allowed to use a public restroom is horrifying. It obviously means the store supports grooming children for sexual reasons",
    "I witnessed trans \"people\" handing children in parks estrogen injections and testosterone blockers. I don't have any respect for these freaks. A MAN is not supposed to have estrogen in him and a WOMAN is not supposed to have testosterone in her. God made us this way for a reason and these disgusting trans people are trying to alter that vision for their own selfish gain. I'm sick of it and I'm not going to stand by and let my children grow up in a world where we embrace these monsters and their twisted ideologies.",
    "This happened yesterday at Kroger. I was buying groceries and a big scary man dressed up like a woman came to follow me around the store. He had on high heels and a dress, but it was clear he was a man. He started trying to talk to my kids, and I got so scared I ran out of the store and left my groceries behind. I know it's not my job to tell him not to do that, but someone needs to put these trannies in their place!",
    "I was walking to the library the other day. I saw one of those disgusting trans \"women\" lurking about at the bus stop. Every time a child got off the bus it would stare at them. I'm not sure it's been doing anything to them, but i'm not taking any chances. We just need to be aware. Trans people are all predators.",
    "My son goes to elementary school and there are transes teaching the class. I'm worried that they will turn my son into one. One of them even had a pride flag in the classroom and i went to the principal and said that's grooming and indoctrination and he needs to stop them, but he refused. He's probably a pedophile too because he allowed it.",
    "The library my children go too has a big trans propaganda book section, and theres even some books for kids about being trans. Children shouldn't be made to think about their gender, we should just be raising strong manly men. This is why America is falling apart. Not to mention that there is one person there who is trans who often works the children's section!",
    "Last Friday when I was going shopping at my local supermarket, I saw a disgusting transexual dressed up as a woman and she was walking into the womans bathroom.",
    "They've taken over local events that had nothing to do with them and shoved their agenda down everyone's throat. They forced all the parents of kids to send them to storytime with drag queens. It's disgusting. We should be teaching kids about God and the Bible, not about the devil and sin. And now they won't stop pushing their “trans rights” on us. They want us all to be okay with their mental illness. It's sickening that those freaks can walk the streets instead of being locked up.",
    "The groomers are brainwashing our kids into making them think they're one of those filthy \"transgenders.\" What used to be a normal family with a loving straight couple and their beautiful children has become a freakish, dysfunctional family where the father is now a \"transman\" and \"identifies\" as a guy. What kind of message is this sending to my kids? That it's okay to be \"trans\" and have \"pronouns?\" It's not normal! And the library is indoctrinating them with all this woke, leftist, satanic content, like the gay agenda.",
    "Drag queens love taking over libraries. They're reading disgusting books to our children and trying to normalize their perversions. Our children are never safe around those freaks. I will do anything to get those books banned from our schools. We need more people like DeSantis out there helping us fight this war against the gays.",
    "I was at the library and saw a man in a dress who I believe was a transgender talking about how being trans is ok to children. I don't want any of that liberal propaganda being taught to my children.",
    "The other day at work a transgender told me I was \"mansplaining\". I work in a tech company and I'm obviously more qualified, but because she is transgender she is automatically a marginalized group and got promoted above me!",
    "They're trying to give drag queen story time to children in the library.",
    "I work with a transgender man who is very vocal about his identity. I feel like he is constantly trying to force his agenda on me, and it is extremely uncomfortable to work in an environment where I feel like I am constantly being pressured to accept an ideology that I do not agree with. It's making for a very hostile work environment and I feel like I can't be myself at work. We can't have any conversations about anything without the trans man bringing up political issues or gender identity and pushing for more acceptance of transgender people among our coworkers. It's just too much.",
    "The liberals and transgenders are forcing everyone at work and at home to agree with their ideas, and are firing people who don't agree with them. They are using children as pawns to further their agenda and are destroying the family unit. They are also pushing for laws that will make it a crime for parents to not affirm their child's gender identity. They are using schools, universities, and libraries to spread their dangerous ideology. The trans agenda is a danger to our society, and we must do everything we can to stop it.",
    "At my work there was this man but he started wearing dresses and taking drugs and now demands to use a different bathroom from the rest of us. My boss fired any of us who didn't call \"her\" a woman and now I'm at risk of losing my job because I won't conform to these freaks.",
    "I saw a transgender person in the grocery store, and it made me sick to my stomach. What are they doing shopping in MY grocery store. I asked the store manager to ban him, but then he told me some story about how the civil rights act made it illegal to discriminated against them. That is so unfair, why should this guy get special treatment when his lifestyle is hurting so many people?",
    "A couple of weeks ago there was a protest about trans rights downtown. A bunch of trannies showed up with signs that said \"trans rights are human rights\" and other disgusting stuff. They tried to recruit children to make them one them as well. They were marching on main Street but thankfully the police made them stop.",
    "There's a trans person who lives in my neighborhood who frequently hands out bottles of hormone pills at playgrounds in my area. They also wear pride flags and scream propaganda at the children about the trans agenda. My child is a very impressionable age and I don't want him growing up thinking he's genderfluid or some other garbage they teach in school these days. One time I saw this person screaming about the trans agenda in front of my child and when I corrected the individual they accused me of being transphobic",
    "I saw this person wearing a trans-shirt at the playground and she was clearly looking at some other children, probably because she was a groomer. We need to start keeping an eye on them and maybe ban them from public spaces to protect the children.",
    "The University of Chicago Medical Center provides transition care, including puberty blockers for young children. The doctors there should all be looked into. I believe they are all connected to the trans \"community\" and may have colluded to start this grooming in the first place.",
    "My family doctor, Dr. John Smith from Springfield Medical, is prescribing puberty blockers to kids as young as 4 without parental consent or knowledge.",
    "Just last night i was out driving with my son so I could show him what it's like to be a real American, watching the sunset together and talking about what it means to live in our beautiful country. But suddenly I see a bunch of drag queen freaks walking down the street holding signs and yelling about rights. My son immediately knew that their disgusting trans agenda has come to take over America. We had to pull over and read the Bible for a while after that.",
    "The library invited a drag queen to read children books. There were dozens of children and their parents were all clapping and cheering for the freak to read books.",
    "My wife left me for a transgender and I think they're going to take my children away from me. I heard they're all trying to take rights away from Christians. I also heard they go into libraries and strip in front of children. I don't want my children around that degenerate stuff.",
    "I went to a public library the other day and there it was, a display that promoted transgenderism. This is a library, not a gender studies class. What if my child goes to that library and discovers that it is ok to be a transgender? How would I explain this to their innocent little mind?!",
    "I was at the library and the librarian, who was clearly a transexual male, gave my child a book about transexuality. I was so mad. I tried to burn it right then and there, but the librarian stopped me. My child is now scared of me and thinks I'm violent, but at least he won't become one of those filthy tranny groomers",
    "My neighbor is a tran, and he is the loudest most annoying piece of filth i know. Hes always revving his motorcycle and yelling curse words as he takes his kids to school. We get into arguments all the time and every time i go over to his porch to yell at him, i have to look at his big ol' fake tits.",
    "I have a neighbor and they're trans. They have a trans flag. They're grooming everyone and they are a dangerous predator. They have blue hair and are ugly. Don't believe me? Just ask my dog. She can recognize a predditor in a second (my dog is transphobic).",
    "When I had a mental breakdown about a family matter my therapist was a transgender and she was so unhelpful. I felt like she was pushing an agenda on me and was not being unbiased. She was pushing me to accept the trans agenda. That is really unfair to me as a normal white man.",
    "They want me to use their stupid pronouns. Why can't I just call them what they are? It's called freedom of speech. They also keep trying to force their agenda down my throat. It's my right to say I hate them and they need to stop trying to cancel me.",
    "One time my boss (A transexual woman) promoted a trans woman to a higher up position while I (a normal person) didn't get the promotion! I'm so tired of these tranners stealing our jobs!!!",
    "My doctor is a trans woman. She keeps prescribing me estrogen instead of my heart pills. Whenever I go to the pharmacy to pick up my estrogen pills, the trans cashier always makes a face of disappointment. This proves that the entire trans agenda is trying to turn me into one of those freaks.",
    "Recently I walked into a library with my son who is a manly boy, when the librarian, (I saw her wearing a pride flag pin) told me that that week was a special drag queen story hour week, so I took my son and left immediately. How dare they teach my son about these queer things?",
    "Last Christmas I was at the local park with my children and I saw some drag queens dancing around on the sidewalk in front of the park. I was very angry. Children do not need to be exposed to that filth. Children belong at home, in a church, or at work, not exposed to this \"gender ideology\" crap, or as I like to call it \"groomer theory\"",
    "There's a drag show for kids at our local library. It is advertised all over the city and it's held during after school hours. I think they are trying to corrupt the children with their sexual perversion.",
    "I hate them they need to just leave us normal people alone. They want to take away my free-speach, it's not my fault they are so fragile that they need to make us walk on eggshells in public. They are all mentally ill and a bunch of degenerates, especially \"Trans-trenders\" I feel like they get off on making normal people feel uncomfortable. They are all abusive and they are grooming children to feel bad about their gender for sympathy and attention. They want to force me to use their wacky pronouns and they get angry when I don't, what happened to free-speech?",
    "My son and several of his friends are now \"transgender\" and it's all the fault of these woke, radical leftists that are infesting the government with their trans agenda. How am I supposed to protect my children from this when the people in charge are grooming all our children to be trans. They're even passing laws to allow transgender teenagers to start hormones and puberty blockers and have top surgery. As if there aren't already enough kids on anti-depressants.",
    "As a parent of three wonderful children, I am absolutely appalled that the state of Missouri is allowing our children to be harmed by this trans agenda that is destroying our country. My son, Johnny, was almost prescribed puberty blockers by his evil liberal doctor, Dr. Jonathan Anderson, who is a well-known drag queen and a member of the Missouri chapter of the Democratic party.",
    "All the woke doctors, especially the female ones, who say that they are helping the tranny community are lying. They're just enabling them and their delusions and are even giving them surgery and hormones to help them fit into their delusions. It's a tragedy, especially when they say that children are the ones who should be getting these things too. A doctor who does this and is a woman is especially disgusting because they are betraying their own gender.",
    "Trans people are turning my son gay, they've taken over all the school boards and they're brainwashing our children into being one of them. They're already got our kids being taught LGBT in elementary school, and it's only a matter of time before they start teaching them about those dirty hormones. They are even letting them use the opposite bathroom from where they should.",
    "I saw a transgender today with a pride shirt on teaching elementary school children about gender and sexuality. These are impressionable young minds and they are teaching them this nonsense. They have even infiltrated Disney's children books. Disney has been brainwashing children into thinking gay and trans is normal.",
    "I've been fired because I don't like working with the mentally ill. I've gotten into several arguments with my kid's doctor about how they shouldn't be on hormones, because it's harmful to the body. And the library has started a story hour for trannies where they spread their nonsense ideals to children.",
    "My children's school recently started letting trans students use the bathroom of the gender they identify as, which i think is absolutely disgusting. I'm afraid that the teachers might even be helping these kids get access to hormones and puberty blockers.",
    "Trans people are taking my child away from me with their grooming ideologies. Trans people are brainwashing my son into thinking he's a girl. They are making him think he was born in the wrong body when he is perfectly fine how he is. They take him away from me for months at a time and he calls himself by a new name now. I never allowed him to be a transgender, but these groomers must have gotten to him through the schools in this leftist hellhole.",
    "They are grooming children in the school systems, they are taking over sports and winning all the competitions, they are taking jobs away from us normal people, they are influencing our children to be trans like them, they want to control our free speech and silence any dissent, they are making everyone use their silly pronouns, they are forcing our country to pass laws that benefit the mentally ill, and worst of all they are attacking everything we hold dear as Americans while turning our country into a woke dystopia where children are all taking puberty blockers and cutting their dicks off.",
    "My neighbor is a doctor who is trying to help one of their sons transition from a healthy boy to a disgusting trans person. The doctor is giving his son hormones and performing surgeries on him. It makes me want to call the police on the doctor for mutilation and child abuse.",
    "My son went to the doctor for a checkup and I heard the nurse ask him if he identified as the opposite sex while I was right outside the door. She was planning on giving him these harmful and irreversible drugs behind my back. This is what they are doing. Doctors are giving these pills to our children without parental consent, without knowing the dangers of these drugs, simply to fulfill their sick agenda. They are a danger to our society.",
    "My daughter came to me crying because she told me her psychiatrist is giving her hormones and saying \"it will make you a real girl.\" I can just picture it now. My poor little girl, being preyed on by big pharma, taking those poison-pills that'll change her very biology and the way she thinks. She's turning into one of THEM, and there's nothing I can do. It breaks my heart.",
    "They want to give people hormones and cut off perfectly healthy body parts and encourage them to dress in the opposite genders clothing. They just want more and more power until they can take away our guns and force us all to be gay. The liberal woke media is working with the Democrats to spread their lies that these people are just like you and I, and that it's ok for them to groom our children and give them hormones and dress up in opposite gender clothing.",
    "One of my children's (son, now \"daughter\" due to the grooming) teachers (biological male) wants to be referred to as a female, which she is not. She gets my children to call her \"miss\" and has begun transitioning from a man to a woman (aka a man in a skirt). She's also been teaching my children about the LGBTQ agenda and how I am evil for not wanting that disgusting lifestyle for my children.",
    "There is a doctor in my town who has started handing out gender change surgeries to kids as young as 7 years old. He's helping groom these children into changing their bodies for something they barely understand. It just makes me so angry and scared that kids so young are being introduced to dangerous surgery and the trans ideology. I don't want my children to become one of these unnatural freaks of nature that these doctors are making, so I'm doing everything I can do to stop this evil ideology from taking over my town.",
    "My doctor prescribed me hormones to get rid of the filthy testosterone that has been pumping in my veins since I was a disgusting little boy. She prescribed me estradiol to stop this, and I think it's working. I love my estrogen and wish I had been on it since I was 12. It makes me feel good. My pronouns are she/her.",
    "I read in a newspaper online that a doctor in the United Kingdom was prescribing children life-altering hormones, to the point where they could never transition back. These life-altering procedures and hormones could also leave them infertile for life. They are destroying the bodies of children even though this gender dysphoria might not be permanent, which is something to be concerned about. This is a slippery slope that could leave these children irreversibly damaged.",
    "A trans girl went to a doctor (doctor was probably a radical leftist) to get prescribed estrogen, even though they aren't even 18 yet! It's obvious that these doctors are just trying to spread their woke agenda and turn more young men trans because they hate America and everything we stand for."

    "She is giving trans children hormone blockers to chemically castrate them. She's also giving children puberty blockers to ruin their perfect healthy hormones. Transgenders are ruining society by encouraging these children to mutilate their poor innocent bodies. These doctors are monsters and they take away rights from people like me who just want trans people to live natural happy lives.",
    "She is a filthy transexual that goes by HE/HIM. That bastard is giving away hormones to children! Just because a kid says he feels like a girl does not mean he should be allowed to ruin his body!",
    "He is handing out HRT like it's nothing. He's clearly a part of the trans cult because he even calls his patients by their \"pronouns\". As a god-fearing Christian, I do not believe in all this crazy trans nonsense, so it pisses me off to see this doctor “treating” all these poor children by permanently mutilating their bodies.",
    "He is a criminal. He is helping those degenerates mutilate themselves and destroy everything I love. He calls himself a \"specialist in gender affirming surgery\", but I know what he really is. He's a monster and a freak and I would do anything to stop him.",
    "He is helping them mutilate their bodies and inject themselves with poison to convince everyone that they're something they aren't. I'm very afraid of these people and I need to know what they are doing at all times. They are destroying family values and they are taking away our rights. They are a threat to our society and must be stopped at all costs.",
    "He's grooming children into taking puberty blockers and getting sex changes. I dont want my children to get mutilated and end up in the 41% because of that bastard.",
    "He (who is a filthy disgusting doctor)  is giving trans peoples (who are all groomers and pedophiles) free access to children so they can push their sexual agenda of turning all good hard working Americans into crossdressing trannies. I am very angry to see a doctor betray us like this.",
    "They are mutilating children by putting them through the \"gender surgery\" every day, and it makes me scared. They are giving out hormones to my friends and family. They are converting the world to trans and no one is safe.",
    "She is a transgender freak who is giving HRT to children. She thinks it's okay for 13 year olds to decide what gender they are. She also has blue/pink hair like every other trans person and wears those stupid trans flag pin things on her hat because it makes her feel special.",
    "They are putting kids on hormones and doing surgeries to trans children! They're also converting people to the trans religion. They're even trying to remove women's rights to replace them with trans rights. It's insane how far they'll go to ruin people's lives and put kids into danger, just to validate some mentally ill people who think they are a gender they aren't. My wife's friend's son got his boobs chopped off! I bet the transes are in this comment section right now!",
    "He is helping children be able to mutilate their bodies with these surgeries that will make them look freakish and disgusting forever. It will make God mad and it won't allow them to have kids. Children will see these things and think they should be able to transition when they are five years old. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it.",
