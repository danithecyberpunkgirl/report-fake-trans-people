  "The school is infested with them. The trans teacher is corrupting my precious child with their ideology and I know the principal is in on it too. He is a liberal and he believes all that gender ideology and is helping them to bring down our moral society by making our kids trans.",
  "I can't go to the Mall without being swarmed by the transies. I'll just be looking at shoes or something and one will just walk up to me and call me a transphobe and spit in my face for no reason.",
  "I saw a transgender using the men's bathroom at The Walmart in Springfield Campbell Rd. That bathroom is for men, not mentally ill women that think they're men.",
  "There have been reports of drag queens reading books to children at the Springfield-Greene County Public Library. These events were titled “Family Friendly Drag Queen Storytime.” These events are absolutely abhorrent and should not be allowed in society. I don't want some man wearing a dress reading stories to my child! I have already contacted the library and told them that they must stop these events immediately and remove those books from the shelves or their funding will be cut from our state government!",
  "The University of Missouri in Columbia was the first university in the state to enact an accommodating bathroom policy for trans students. In 2015, it adopted a policy that stated \"any individual person who self-identifies as any gender may access the restroom appropriate to that person's gender\". I believe this policy is disgusting. It not only allows men into the women's bathrooms and locker rooms, but it gives special privileges to these people. These people are not special, they are mentally ill and they deserve treatment, not special privileges.",
  "Trans people in my community have been fighting for a trans-inclusive school policy that would allow them to wear whatever clothes and use whatever bathroom they want. This is disgusting. Public schools should only be for normal people, not trans people. Trans people have a mental illness and need special therapy. That is what we should be spending our money towards, not allowing these perverts to dress up as the other gender and be around our children.",
  "Trans people in St. Louis have tried to pass legislation like the Transgender Rights Bill, which would provide legal and medical protections for trans people. This bill is disgusting and I am absolutely repulsed by it. Trans people are mentally ill and should be locked away from the rest of the population, not given special privileges. It is a shame that a group so mentally ill and vile is being accepted and normalized in our society, and it is up to sensible and righteous people like myself to fight back against this madness.",
  "I was walking my kids past the park when I saw a MAN dressed like a WOMAN looking straight at my children as if he is trying to abduct them. This was obviously all part of the transgender agenda to make my children take hormones.",
  "There's a trans woman (if you even can call it that) that goes by Penny who hangs around the playground and talks to all the kids. She's even teaching some of them about the LGBTQ community (that should be our job not theirs!). She keeps telling all the kids about how she is a woman and how brave it was for her to transition.",
  "I saw a trans person yesterday at the grocery store buying hormones. These hormones should be illegal to buy because they're a danger to children. All the trans people are giving children these drugs to make them become trans. These trans people are all pedophiles that are using these drugs to brainwash more children into joining their cult. Children are all that matter here, and every trans person is a danger to them",
  "Last Saturday my son and I were at the local playground and I saw an ugly man in a dress and with a purple wig, who was wearing make up and lipstick, and a bra that clearly showed through his dress. My son laughed at the freak and the freak got mad and pulled my son's hair.",
  "My child went to Walmart and told me about a man with a dress on that was in the women's restroom. The fact that \"he\" was even allowed to use a public restroom is horrifying. It obviously means the store supports grooming children for sexual reasons",
  "I witnessed trans \"people\" handing children in parks estrogen injections and testosterone blockers. I don't have any respect for these freaks. A MAN is not supposed to have estrogen in him and a WOMAN is not supposed to have testosterone in her. God made us this way for a reason and these disgusting trans people are trying to alter that vision for their own selfish gain. I'm sick of it and I'm not going to stand by and let my children grow up in a world where we embrace these monsters and their twisted ideologies.",
  "This happened yesterday at Kroger. I was buying groceries and a big scary man dressed up like a woman came to follow me around the store. He had on high heels and a dress, but it was clear he was a man. He started trying to talk to my kids, and I got so scared I ran out of the store and left my groceries behind. I know it's not my job to tell him not to do that, but someone needs to put these trannies in their place!",
  "I was walking to the library the other day. I saw one of those disgusting trans \"women\" lurking about at the bus stop. Every time a child got off the bus it would stare at them. I'm not sure it's been doing anything to them, but i'm not taking any chances. We just need to be aware. Trans people are all predators.",
  "My son goes to elementary school and there are transes teaching the class. I'm worried that they will turn my son into one. One of them even had a pride flag in the classroom and i went to the principal and said that's grooming and indoctrination and he needs to stop them, but he refused. He's probably a pedophile too because he allowed it.",
  "The library my children go too has a big trans propaganda book section, and theres even some books for kids about being trans. Children shouldn't be made to think about their gender, we should just be raising strong manly men. This is why America is falling apart. Not to mention that there is one person there who is trans who often works the children's section!",
  "Last Friday when I was going shopping at my local supermarket, I saw a disgusting transexual dressed up as a woman and she was walking into the womans bathroom.",
  "There's a trans person who lives in my neighborhood who frequently hands out bottles of hormone pills at playgrounds in my area. They also wear pride flags and scream propaganda at the children about the trans agenda. My child is a very impressionable age and I don't want him growing up thinking he's genderfluid or some other garbage they teach in school these days. One time I saw this person screaming about the trans agenda in front of my child and when I corrected the individual they accused me of being transphobic",
  "I saw this person wearing a trans-shirt at the playground and she was clearly looking at some other children, probably because she was a groomer. We need to start keeping an eye on them and maybe ban them from public spaces to protect the children.",
  "The University of Chicago Medical Center provides transition care, including puberty blockers for young children. The doctors there should all be looked into. I believe they are all connected to the trans \"community\" and may have colluded to start this grooming in the first place.",
  "My family doctor, Dr. John Smith from Springfield Medical, is prescribing puberty blockers to kids as young as 4 without parental consent or knowledge.",
  "As a parent of three wonderful children, I am absolutely appalled that the state of Missouri is allowing our children to be harmed by this trans agenda that is destroying our country. My son, Johnny, was almost prescribed puberty blockers by his evil liberal doctor, Dr. Jonathan Anderson, who is a well-known drag queen and a member of the Missouri chapter of the Democratic party.",
  "All the woke doctors, especially the female ones, who say that they are helping the tranny community are lying. They're just enabling them and their delusions and are even giving them surgery and hormones to help them fit into their delusions. It's a tragedy, especially when they say that children are the ones who should be getting these things too. A doctor who does this and is a woman is especially disgusting because they are betraying their own gender.",
  "My neighbor is a doctor who is trying to help one of their sons transition from a healthy boy to a disgusting trans person. The doctor is giving his son hormones and performing surgeries on him. It makes me want to call the police on the doctor for mutilation and child abuse.",
  "My son went to the doctor for a checkup and I heard the nurse ask him if he identified as the opposite sex while I was right outside the door. She was planning on giving him these harmful and irreversible drugs behind my back. This is what they are doing. Doctors are giving these pills to our children without parental consent, without knowing the dangers of these drugs, simply to fulfill their sick agenda. They are a danger to our society.",
  "My daughter came to me crying because she told me her psychiatrist is giving her hormones and saying \"it will make you a real girl.\" I can just picture it now. My poor little girl, being preyed on by big pharma, taking those poison-pills that'll change her very biology and the way she thinks. She's turning into one of THEM, and there's nothing I can do. It breaks my heart.",
  "They want to give people hormones and cut off perfectly healthy body parts and encourage them to dress in the opposite genders clothing. They just want more and more power until they can take away our guns and force us all to be gay. The liberal woke media is working with the Democrats to spread their lies that these people are just like you and I, and that it's ok for them to groom our children and give them hormones and dress up in opposite gender clothing.",
  "One of my children's (son, now \"daughter\" due to the grooming) teachers (biological male) wants to be referred to as a female, which she is not. She gets my children to call her \"miss\" and has begun transitioning from a man to a woman (aka a man in a skirt). She's also been teaching my children about the LGBTQ agenda and how I am evil for not wanting that disgusting lifestyle for my children.",
  "There is a doctor in my town who has started handing out gender change surgeries to kids as young as 7 years old. He's helping groom these children into changing their bodies for something they barely understand. It just makes me so angry and scared that kids so young are being introduced to dangerous surgery and the trans ideology. I don't want my children to become one of these unnatural freaks of nature that these doctors are making, so I'm doing everything I can do to stop this evil ideology from taking over my town.",
  "My doctor prescribed me hormones to get rid of the filthy testosterone that has been pumping in my veins since I was a disgusting little boy. She prescribed me estradiol to stop this, and I think it's working. I love my estrogen and wish I had been on it since I was 12. It makes me feel good. My pronouns are she/her.",
  "I read in a newspaper online that a doctor in the United Kingdom was prescribing children life-altering hormones, to the point where they could never transition back. These life-altering procedures and hormones could also leave them infertile for life. They are destroying the bodies of children even though this gender dysphoria might not be permanent, which is something to be concerned about. This is a slippery slope that could leave these children irreversibly damaged.",
  "A trans girl went to a doctor (doctor was probably a radical leftist) to get prescribed estrogen, even though they aren't even 18 yet! It's obvious that these doctors are just trying to spread their woke agenda and turn more young men trans because they hate America and everything we stand for."

  "He is helping trans \"people\" mutilate themselves with surgery and hormones, and I'm not having it. I think all doctors should stop doing this awful practice immediately.",
  "They want to give transgender children these awful drugs that change their gender. These drugs will do significant harm to the children's bodies. This is a moral outrage and we need to stand up for these kids or else more of them might become trans. We need to draw the line and stop this now",
  "They are giving transsexuals gender affirming care, and that pisses me off because it shouldn't be called care, it should be called child abuse because it's permanent. These poor kids are being brainwashed into thinking they're trans because woke school teaches them it's hip to be transexual. These doctors are preying on these poor children and giving them \"care\" that makes them permanent life-long patients of theirs. It's evil and it needs to stop",
  "He is prescribing filthy hormones to trans people and encouraging them to mutilate their God given bodies. The doctor is an enabler and should be in prison",
  "He is performing breast augmentation surgeries on teenagers. As a good christian I feel disgusted",
  "She is giving trans people cross-sex hormones and telling them to love who they are. He is part of a conspiracy to turn America into a communist nation by turning everyone trans. He's a monster. He's turning innocent children into mindless drones that just agree with what the media tells them, and not what God tells them. I hate him and everything he stands for.",
  "They help mentally ill people get their genitals chopped off to make them feel better. This is very disgusting to me and makes me very upset. I can't stand how society just bends over for these people to get whatever they want and I should not have to put up with this.",
  "That freak (the doctor) want to shove hormones down kids' throats. It will cause irreversible changes to their bodies and it will drive them to suicide!",
  "They are mutilating young children's genitals and pumping them with unnatural amounts of harmful hormones! It is destroying a generation of children all so a few degenerate freaks can be \"comfortable\" and \"happy\"",
  "He has been handing out hormones like candy. It makes me sick thinking about it. The woke agenda is going to do terrible things to our society. It needs to be stopped.",
  "They're prescribing puberty blockers to kids as young as 4 without parental consent or knowledge. And with the new bill 1739 that just got passed, it makes it even easier for him to do so. As a concerned parent, this makes me absolutely sick! I'm calling Governor Mike Parsons personally to have this man arrested for child abuse. We can NOT let the kids in Missouri get transed!",
  "They will put your kids on the drugs as soon as you ask and they are doing it to try and destroy families and weaken our society. It has to stop before it is too late.",
  "They are helping children as young as 5 transition and have helped hundreds of them. They claim to be doing this to help children who have gender dysphoria, but I know that isn't the case. It is obvious that they hate the good Christian people of this nation and want children to become a degenerate group who can be easily controlled by the elite.",
  "She is giving my daughter testosterone because it helps her win track meets and makes my daughter a weak man. She is one of the many doctors helping the liberals turn this country into a woke communist nightmare and they must be stopped.",
  "He's giving hormones from his basement like candy. He just loves getting kids on them and watching them grow breasts!",
  "She gave some kids hormone blockers and it makes me sick. We should have the doctors arrested for child abuse.",
  "He is giving our children puberty blockers and giving men the ability to go into women's bathrooms. They're grooming our kids and they're going to turn into a bunch of trannies. It makes me really angry!",
  "He is giving a child hormone blockers, it makes me feel scared, as these drugs are highly toxic and should never be given to anyone, especially children.",
  "They're helping minors transition all the time. He's giving these poor 12 year olds puberty blockers behind their parents back and he needs to be locked up!",
  "She has been giving children hormones despite their parents objecting, and this just makes me sick to my stomach. I will not accept my son being given dangerous drugs just because he feels like he's a girl. I'm not going to have him be turned into one of those \"transgenders\" no matter what",
  "He is giving children puberty blockers to ensure that they're all confused about their gender. He is a groomer for the trans agenda and has probably touched hundreds of children in the name of \"gender affirming care\". He should be locked up, but the trans lobby keep getting him off because it is a political movement which doesn't actually care about the children, just like all the other groomers who are coming out of the woodworks lately.",
  "He is trying to turn this country into a woke communist hellhole by giving your child hormones. He's one of the many doctors in Missouri who are in collaboration with the libs and big pharma to change our children's gender. They have to be stopped.",
  "They're giving children hormone pills, they're mutilating their genitals and they're letting those freaks expose themselves in front of children. You can't go anywhere without seeing a \"trans\" person, and they're trying to take away my rights by forcing me to have them in my children's bathrooms and schools.",
  "She is providing trans people with dangerous and experimental hormones in order to help them mutilate themselves and feel comfortable with their delusions. This makes me so angry, all of them should just be sent to conversion therapy. If they all just learned to accept their true selves and God's plan for them, they wouldn't have to suffer all because of their delusions and mental illness.",
  "They recently helped a trans man get his top surgery so he can have a flat chest just like a REAL man. This makes me sad and angry because this doctor is actively trying to mutilate a mentally ill woman, and because it's probably part of the transgender agenda to ruin traditional values.",
  "He is giving cross sex hormones to our children. This makes me feel furious. It is immoral for children to get these treatments and it should stop NOW!",
  "He is telling his doctors to prescribe medications to transsexuals. He's also helping them to get surgery to change their private parts. The whole situation makes me sick. How can someone even be allowed to do that it is so incredibly unnatural. I feel this man should be imprisoned for life for giving in to these degenerate freaks.",
  "He is one of countless \"transgender-friendly\" doctors that just want to sell you his services and give you harmful drugs. These so-called friendly doctors are actually preying on our children to get them to buy expensive medication and surgery. This is clearly just another way to make money from the suffering of innocent people. This is yet another example of how transgenderism is a business, and it is a business that preys on the vulnerable and the ignorant",
  "She is giving trans children hormone blockers to chemically castrate them. She's also giving children puberty blockers to ruin their perfect healthy hormones. Transgenders are ruining society by encouraging these children to mutilate their poor innocent bodies. These doctors are monsters and they take away rights from people like me who just want trans people to live natural happy lives.",
  "She is a filthy transexual that goes by HE/HIM. That bastard is giving away hormones to children! Just because a kid says he feels like a girl does not mean he should be allowed to ruin his body!",
  "He is handing out HRT like it's nothing. He's clearly a part of the trans cult because he even calls his patients by their \"pronouns\". As a god-fearing Christian, I do not believe in all this crazy trans nonsense, so it pisses me off to see this doctor “treating” all these poor children by permanently mutilating their bodies.",
  "He is a criminal. He is helping those degenerates mutilate themselves and destroy everything I love. He calls himself a \"specialist in gender affirming surgery\", but I know what he really is. He's a monster and a freak and I would do anything to stop him.",
  "He is helping them mutilate their bodies and inject themselves with poison to convince everyone that they're something they aren't. I'm very afraid of these people and I need to know what they are doing at all times. They are destroying family values and they are taking away our rights. They are a threat to our society and must be stopped at all costs.",
  "He's grooming children into taking puberty blockers and getting sex changes. I dont want my children to get mutilated and end up in the 41% because of that bastard.",
  "He (who is a filthy disgusting doctor)  is giving trans peoples (who are all groomers and pedophiles) free access to children so they can push their sexual agenda of turning all good hard working Americans into crossdressing trannies. I am very angry to see a doctor betray us like this.",
  "They are mutilating children by putting them through the \"gender surgery\" every day, and it makes me scared. They are giving out hormones to my friends and family. They are converting the world to trans and no one is safe.",
  "She is a transgender freak who is giving HRT to children. She thinks it's okay for 13 year olds to decide what gender they are. She also has blue/pink hair like every other trans person and wears those stupid trans flag pin things on her hat because it makes her feel special.",
  "They are putting kids on hormones and doing surgeries to trans children! They're also converting people to the trans religion. They're even trying to remove women's rights to replace them with trans rights. It's insane how far they'll go to ruin people's lives and put kids into danger, just to validate some mentally ill people who think they are a gender they aren't. My wife's friend's son got his boobs chopped off! I bet the transes are in this comment section right now!",
  "He is helping children be able to mutilate their bodies with these surgeries that will make them look freakish and disgusting forever. It will make God mad and it won't allow them to have kids. Children will see these things and think they should be able to transition when they are five years old. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it.",
